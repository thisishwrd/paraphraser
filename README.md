# paraphraser
NLP model that takes a source sentence and produces N paraphrased sentences based on it.

## About this project
Paraphrasing, or *a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words*, is an important part in creating chatbots and voice assistants. As finding and creating texts with similar meanings to an user's input is time consuming, this **paraphraser** is meant to automate this tedious process.
